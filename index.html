					For most runtimes, processes are transient meaning, when they are restarted, they are conceptually dependent on external persistent computing elements to recap their whereabouts at their last exit. What if this wasn't the default case for processes? What if, instead, processes, after they have been stopped, simply always continue from where they left of?
				</div>
				<div>
					These are some of the driving points of Duro. Overall, Duro is an attempt to make a runtime for persistent processes.

					Many applications, compiled from source code, have very little relation to its source code after compilation; e.g., there is limited semantical changes tracked when new compilations are made. These applications feel static.
				</div>
				<div>
					Applications for Duro should feel like they were built to evolve. The creation of many software applications share much with weather prediction anyway, so why not have this in mind for the supporting tool?

					The current goal is to implement an ECMAScript-like frontend for the runtime simply named Duro. Duro is to have the same role as Java has for the JVM. With a twist. Where Java is compiled to programs, from which processes are derived from - Duro is compiled directly to processes which are simply resumed each time they are given to the runtime. The initially compiled processes are called <span style="font-style:oblique;">genesis processes</span> are compiled.
				</div>
				<div>
					A genesis process contains the origins of the possible evolutions and is represented by an empty extensible journal of instructions associated to an initial sequence of instructions. After a genesis process has been resumed, its journal is no longer empty and the process is no longer a genesis process. Each time a process is resumed, it is evaluated until either a pause- or finish instruction is met. When a pause instruction is met, the process stops and will resume at exactly that point upon resumption. When a finish instruction is met, the process simply finishes and can no longer be resumed.
