****Add new shorthand function literal (and single parameter calls)****

{x > 50;} // Any non declared variables (or parameters locally or in creation scope) that are used, are considered parameters.

A more pragmatic suggestion could include prefixing with colons - as follows:
{:x > 50;}
This may be better, since then the regular id form can be used for binding in a more implicit way. E.g.
If there is a corresponding argument in the current context, bind to it.
If there is a corresponding variable in the current context (declared before this usage), bind to it.
If there is a corresponding argument in the lexical scope, bind to it.
If there is a corresponding variable in the lexical scope, bind to it.
Otherwise, assume it is a message send, or member resolution, to self.

{x < y} // Parameter sequence is indicated by usage sequence
<=>
function(x, y) {return x < y;}

list.sort({x > y;})
list.sort({x > y})
list.sort: {x > y;} // Single parameter call
list.sort: {x > y} // Single parameter call

list.where({x > 50;})
list.where({x > 50})
list.where: {x > 50;} // Single parameter call
list.where: {x > 50} // Single parameter call

{|x y| y <= x} // Parameter sequence indicated explicitly

Implications:
There is certain overlap with the object literal syntax, that implicates ambiguity as to the following form:
{}
Here, it cannot be derived whether an empty block or an empty object is to be created. This could possibly be solved by having the following form for empty functions:
{;}
or something similar.

Alternatively, the object literal syntax should change to using brackets as illustrated below. 
Since, brackets in functions indicates behavior and square brackets in arrays indicate structure, object literals seem to fit better with using square brackets, since it is basically a structure: a dictionary.

Object literal:
"[" (":" | keyValuePair*) "]"
Array literal:
"[" (expression (", " expression)*)? "]"

Object literal with four members:
[
   toCompare: {|x y| x < y},
   toCompare2: {x < y}
   toCompare3: function() {x < y}
   toCompare4: function(x, y) {x < y}
]

Object literal with no members:
[:]

Array literal with four items:
[1, 2, 3, 5]

Array literal with no items:
[]

****Optional assignment****

x ?= y;
<=>
if(x == null)
	x = y;

x is set to y if x is null.

****Functions as closure***

Let functions be closures. I.e. upon their creation, they are bound to their "creation context" implicating arguments, variables, and the like are implicitly bound locally outwards.
